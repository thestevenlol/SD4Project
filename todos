* Experiment with seed files and mutation rather than random generation.
* Investigate reading TestCov results to introduce coverage feedback (Core improvement)
* Improve user-friendliness (Input, output, logging, configuration, crash logging(?))

Timeframe:
1 week: 
- Revise design document
-- Goals
-- Architecture
-- Fuzzing techniques
-- UI & Config
-- Error handling?
-- Technology stack and tools used

2-3 weeks (Up until beta release on feb 14th)
-- Seed input handling (get seeds from benchmark files/problem files using lexical analysis.)
-- Integer mutations from seed files

- Coverage feedback
-- Automatic execution of target multiple times (i.e. run fuzzing once, read coverage, improve inputs, repeat)
